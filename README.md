# Ohio-State-Assignments
These are some of the data analytics and statistics projects I completed using python for my astrophysics and physics courses at Ohio State. 

Because these assignemnts were for my astrophysics/physics courses, some of the data itself may be hard to understand for those not familiar with physics or astronomy. However, I think these assignments serve as a good example for my Python skills and some of the things I learned at Ohio State.
