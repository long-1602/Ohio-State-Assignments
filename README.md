# Ohio-State-Assignments
These are some of the data analytics assignments I completed using python for my astrophysics courses at Ohio State. 

Because these assignemnts were for my astrophysics courses, the data itself may be hard to understand for those not familiar with astrophysics. However, I think these assignments serve as a good example for my Python skills and some of the things I learned at Ohio State.
